# MOSFET and IGBT Gate Driving Design Analysis

MOSFET and IGBT Gate Driving design is analyzed using theoretical calculations and supported by simulations. 

This gate drive design is controlled by an isolated micerocontroller PWM output. Isolation is achieved using optocouplers.

Totem-pole drivers are first considered.
